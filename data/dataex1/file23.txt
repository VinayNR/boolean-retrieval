On 26 August 2008, Cazorla announced that Real Madrid were interested in signing him.
 He then went on to cause a stir in the media by rejecting the team, announcing that, "There are many other things in football besides Real Madrid. It's clear that it is possible to say 'no' to them, there is no doubt that they are a great team, but I also feel very satisfied and valued at my club."
 He added, "I hope I can continue growing at Villarreal because I am young and I’m only starting off with the national team.
 He missed several games but el Submarino Amarillo still managed to qualify for the Europa League, as the player made his comeback earlier than expected in the side's final match, a 3–2 win at Mallorca, and finished the league campaign with a career-high eight goals.
